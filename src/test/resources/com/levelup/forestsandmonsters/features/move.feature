I want to move my character. If they attempt to 
move past a boundary, the move results in no change in position.

Scenario Outline: Move in a direction
    Given the character starts at position with XCoordinates <startingPositionX> 
    And starts at YCoordinates <startingPositionY>
    And the turn count is <turnCountBefore>
    And the player choses to move in <direction>
    When the character moves
    Then the character is now at position with XCoordinates <endingPositionX>
    And YCoordinates <endingPositionY>
    And the new turn count is <turnCountAfter>
    Examples:
        | startingPositionX | startingPositionY | turnCountBefore | direction | endingPositionX | endingPositionY | turnCountAfter |
        | 0 | 0 | 103 | NORTH | 0 | 1 | 104 |
        | 0 | 0 | 32 | SOUTH | 0 | 0 | 33 |
        | 0 | 0 | 27 | WEST  | 0 | 0 | 28 |
